				<h3 id = "docs-overview">Overview</h3>
					<p>This documentation provides a concise explanation of how to use the application. The documentation outlines the different type of users and the type of permissions. It outlines the features available and instructions on how to fill out the various forms, that enable the various users to interact with the site.</p>
					<h3 id = "docs-background">Background</h3>
					<p>Bug Issue Tracker Solutions provides an easy-to-use web-based application tool to help individuals and businesses track issues and find lasting solutions to their needs. It is driven by a vibrant user community ensuring collobaration on all levels.
					The application incorporates different apps to provide a range of functionality. It integrates a tracker list containing a list of bugs and features with other applications. 
					The tracker list consists of a summary list of issues with which various users can interact with, the degree of interaction relative to the level of permission, on authentication. Authorised users at minimum can create their own bugs and features and follow their development through the ability to comment and post blogs. A search app allows users to search the summary list by name. Authentication is through the use of an accounts app, where users either sign in or register. Template logic is used to allow the users access to various features subject to their level of permission. Staff users have further permissions to edit items while superusers have full permissions. An e-commerce functionality is provided through the use of cart and checkout apps with the stripe application used to handle payments. At least 50% of time is spent developing the highest paid features, with the remaining time spent fixing bugs for free. Upvoting is incorporated into the issues_list app for bugs (free upvote) and the cart and checkout apps for features (upvoted for a fee). A chart app provides transparency to users on time spent working on bugs and features. Non-authenticated users can access the home, about and activities pages to read about BITS and sign up if they desire so.</p>
				<h3 id = "user-perm">User Permissions</h3>
						<p>Users basically consist of non-authenticated and authenticated users (general and staff). Non-authenticated users have no authorisation with authenticated users having varying permissions depending on if they are general users or staff.</p>
				 	<h4 id = "non-auth">Non-authenticated users</h4>
						<p>These users have basic access to the application to view the home page, the about page, the activities page, the documentation page and the login/registration forms.  </p>
					<h4 id = "authen-gen">Authenticated general users:</h4>
						<p>These are the users who have registered and can log in. These users have access to the home page, about page, activities page, tracker list, charts, documentation and blog page.</p>
						<p>These users can also:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>add items (bugs and/or features) to the tracker list.</li>
							<li>upvote a bug or a feature</li>
							<li>access the cart</li>
							<li>comment on issues</li>
							<li>post a blog or comment on a post</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These users drive the activities. However they cannot edit or delete items, even their own items. If a user wishes their item to be edited or removed it can be done by directly adding it as a comment on the issue or by referring to it in a blog post. Authorised staff will pick up on it and act accordingly.</p>
					<h4 id = "authen-staff">Staff users</h4>
						<p>Staff users are responsible for the daily implementation of the activities and deal with the issues raised. Staff users have the permissions of the general users and also have access to all elements of the application including the backend admin panel. Currently there are 2 authorised superusers who have full administration rights to add to or edit any editable field registered in the admin panel. Any registered item can be deleted by these users. However any decisions to amend any aspects of the application are agreed on at the fortnightly staff meetings. The only exception is when a user requests their submitted item to be adjusted/deleted, which is done immediately. Staff users can also edit issues and blog posts directly in the browser via an edit form. Comments are not edited but are approved by staff (i.e accepted or deleted).</p>
					<h5><em>Senior staff:</em></h5>
						<p> Three senior staff members, although not superusers, have full administration permissions (CRUD).</p>
					<h5><em>Junior staff:</em></h5>
						<p>Two other more junior staff have permissions to read, create and edit items.</p>
				<h3 id = "features">Features</h3>
						<p>The features of this web application are described below.</p>
					<h4 id = "home_page">Home Page:</h4>
						<p>The home page is effectively a landing page and introduces BITS. The jumbotron section contains the callout while the feature section summarises existing and future features.</p>
						<p>The home page uses template logic to present slightly different elements depending on user authorisation. Non authenticated users see the basic nav bar with links to the elements as described in <a href= "#non-auth" title="Go to user section"> non-authenticated users above</a>. The nav bar also has links to login and register (profile and logout for authorised users). Also there is a signup button in the jumbotron area (or a view tracker button for authenticated users) with “You must login or signup” text (or “Feel free to add an issue or comment on issues”  for authorised users).</p>
					<h4 id = "about_page">About Page:</h4>
						<p>The about page gives some background information on BITS, along with  more insight into who is involved and what exactly BITS does. Non authenticated users see the basic nav bar. The background, image logo and team details are the same for all users.</p>
					<h4 id = "activities_page">Activities Page:</h4>
						<p>This page shows some general statistics on activities to date. The issues are separated into bugs and features. Some graphs are also shown to visually represent the status on bugs and features to date along with the proportion of bugs to features. All users see this detail. The only difference is that non authenticated users see the basic nav bar.</p>
					<h4 id = "view-issues-list">Issues List:</h4>
						<p>This page presents the Issues Tracker List, which shows a summary list of all bugs and features to date. Only authorised users have access to this page, thus the full nav bar is available.</p>
						<p>This list consists of a table of all bugs and features and adopts a color code (using bootstrap color styles):</p>
						<ul>
							<li>completed items are colored green.</li>
							<li>ongoing items are colored yellow. </li>
							<li>pending items are colored red.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Items are sorted in thefollowing order:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>highest fee received.</li>
							<li>highest number of upvotes.</li>
							<li>status descending alphabetically.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Bootstrap Tooltips are available adding helper text to any links.</p>
						<p>The table consists of the following columns:</p>
					<h5 ><a href="#editing" title="See editing forms section"><em>Edit:</em></a></h5>
						<p>Staff authorised users have access to an edit icon which when clicked takes you to the edit form page where items can be edited.</p>
					<h5><a href="#upvoting" title="See upvoting section"><em>Upvote:</em></a></h5>
						<p>There is an upvote icon, which when clicked allows any authorised user to add an upvote to a bug or take you to a feature detail page where you can add feature upvotes to the cart.</p>
						<p><strong>Note:</strong> Users only get one vote for a bug but can vote any number of times for a feature. Upvotes are added to features after <a href="#payments" title="Go to payments section">payment</a> is received.</p>
					<h5><em>Name:</em></h5>
						<p>This is the title of the submitted feature or bug</p>
					<h5><em>Content:</em></h5>
						<p> This is a short truncated description of the bug or feature and all authorised users can view the <a href ="#issue_detail" title="Go to issue detail section">full detail</a> by clicking on the content link.</p>
					<h5><em>Submitted by:</em></h5>
						<p>This shows the username of the user that submitted the bug or feature.</p>
					<h5><em>Category:</em></h5>
						<p>This is either bug or feature and is selected by the user when submitting the new item through the <a href = "#add-item" title = "Go to the forms section">form.</a></p>
					<h5><em>Created on:</em></h5>
						<p>The date the new item (bug or feature) was submitted.</p>
					<h5><em>Upvotes:</em></h5>
						<p>The total number of upvotes recieved to date.</p>
					<h5><em>Status:</em></h5>
						<p>The status (Pending, Ongoing, Completed) of the item. On submission of the new item the default is always Pending. Whoever is assigned the item then alters the status. It will be assigned the status of Ongoing when the item is assigned and work on the item has commenced. Eventually it will be assigned status Completed when all the work is complete.The status is altered through the admin panel or through the edit form.</p>
					<h5><em>Assigned to:</em></h5>
						<p>This is the name of the staff member to which the item has been assigned.</p>
					<h5><em>Progress:</em></h5>
						<p>This is a progress note added by staff relative to the status of the issue. For pending items it may read queued, or awaiting upvotes. For ongoing it may read in development or testing ongoing. For completed it may contain a few words stating the final outcome.</p>
					<h5><em>Fees:</em></h5>
						<p>This is the total fees received for a feature item. On successful payment of an upvote fee, it is added to the existing fee total. Bugs are currently fixed for free so this item will always read 0.00 for bugs.</p>
					<h5><em>Comments:</em></h5>
						<p>This field contains a comment icon which, when clicked takes the authorised user to the <a href="#issue_detail" title="Go to issue detail section"> detail view</a> where comments can be viewed. The total number of comments received is also displayed beside the icon in list view and on the detail view page. On the detail view page, there are also links to return to the list view, to upvote or to add a new comment.</p>
						<p>At the top of the table there is a search box where a user can enter text to search the list by the name column. At the bottom of the table is pagination functionality allowing a user to quickly navigate the different pages.</p>
					<h4 id = "create-item">Create an Item:</h4>
						<p>Clicking on this takes the authorised user to the create an <a href="#add-item" title = "Go to create a new item form section">item form.</a> Data is required in all fields. Fill in the name section, add some content (full description of the issue) and select either bug or feature in the drop down  category section and then save to commit the item to the <a href ="#view-issues-list" title="Go to issues list section">tracker issues list.</a> Additional fields are automatically added to the issues list such as status (default is pending), created date, author, upvotes (default is zero), assigned to (default is not yet) and fees (default is zero). The default fields are updated on edit or by an action such as upvoting or making a payment. Additional fields for assigned date and completed date are also added but only visible for edit on the edit form or through the admin panel. The created date is also entered into these fields when a new item is created. This default date does not affect any calculations. These default dates can be removed through an edit or left in and updated when updating status. When updated these fields are used to calculate durations for output in charts. There is also a hidden price field, allowing the price per upvote to be updated at a future date through the admin panel.</p>
					<h4 id = "view-charts">View Charts:</h4>
						<p>This link takes the authorised user to the graphs page. All graphs are rendered using dc.js crossfilter. The first section of graphs consists of 6 bar chart type graphs. The first three show the distribution on categories to date, the status on those categories and the upvotes recieved to date. The second three show the total amount of days spent working on issues (completed) and (ongoing) and the duration of pending issues. These graphs are all based on the same crossfilter and thus are interactive with each other. Theses graphs plot data for the entire history and thus will always contain data.</p>
						<p>The next section contains a piechart showing the percentage of fees received for features by status. This graph is based on the same crossfilter as above and thus is interactive with the feature element of other graphs.</p>
						<p>The final section contains graphs showing the ratio of bugs and features completed and ongoing respectively over the last week and the last 31 days (monthly). These latter graphs show data related to the recent past and thus may contain empty data if there has been no activities within that time period. However in a real world situation a popular application should always have adequate recent activities that can be visually represented in charts.  </p>
					<h4 id = "view-docs">Documentation</h4>
						<p>This link takes the user to the documents page. The documents outline the features and detail any instructions needed to fill out forms and navigate the site. The contents are listed in the side-nav bar. Clicking on a heading will bring the user to the respective paragraph in the contents page. Within the contents text there are also hyperlinks, which when clicked, bring the user to other sections of the document.</p>
					<h4 id = "blog-page">Blog Page</h4>
						<p>Access to the blog page is via the nav bar link. All authorised users can view the blog page. Once on the blog page posts can be read. To read more <a href = "#view-blog" title="Go to blog detail section">detail</a> on a post or leave a comment on the post click on the read more button whch takes the user to the specific detail page.  
						<p> The blog page may contain the following detail</p>
						<ul>
							<li>image: An image of the author.</li>
							<li>author: The username of the author.</li>
							<li>title: The title of the post.</li>
							<li>content: The subject matter of the post.</li>
							<li>read more link: A button link to the detail view.</li>
							<li>date published: The date the post was created.</li>
							<li>views: The number of views it has received.</li>
							<li>tag: Keyword(s) reflecting the post.</li>
						</ul>
					<h4 id = "view-blog">View blog detail</h4>
						<p>When a user clicks on the read more button of a blog post they are taken to the detail view. On this page all authorised users can add a <a href = "#comment-blog" title="Go to blog form section"> comment</a>. A staff user can also edit the post. The staff user also sees ok or delete icons, enabling them to either approve or delete the comment, based on the appropriateness of the comment. The back to blog button takes the user back to the blog posts list page.</p>
						<p>The blog detail page also shows the number of comments and all comments associated with the post item.</p>
					<h4 id = "new-blog">New Blog Post</h4>
						<p>Any authorised user can post a new blog by clicking on the link on the nav bar. The link takes you to a blank <a href="#form-blog" title="Go to blog form section"> form</a> where a user adds a title, the content, their image and a tag. Clicking on the save button adds the post to the posts list.</p>
					<h4 id = "profile-view">Profile</h4>
						<p>When an authorised user click on this nav-bar link, it reveals some details of the user. This version shows e-mail address, username, first name and last name.</p>
					<h4 id = "logout">Logout</h4>
						<p>When a user clicks this they are logged out and any cart items are lost.</p>
					<h4 id = "view-cart">View Cart</h4>
						<p>All authorised users can click on the cart in the nav bar to view their cart items. Cart items will remain in the cart until either the user has made payment or until the user is logged out. Items are added to the cart when the upvote button is clicked. If no upvotes are added, the form returns a message stating that a minimum of one upvote is required. Adding upvotes and clicking the upvote button puts the number of upvotes for that particular feature in the cart. By following the same process other features with upvotes can be added to the cart. The cart shows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the title of the feature being upvoted.</li>
							<li>the first 5 words of the content.</li>
							<li>the price per upvote.</li>
							<li>the total fees due for upvotes.</li>
							<li>the number of upvotes.</li>
							<li>the total fees due for all features</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Within the cart the user can:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>amend the number of upvotes by adjusting the number selector and clicking amend.</li>
							<li>delete the upvotes by returning the number selector to 0 and clicking amend.</li>
							<li>add more items to the cart by clicking the back to tracker button and clicking on the <a href = "#upvoting" title = "Go to upvote section">upvote</a> icon in the issues list.</li>
							<li>proceed to the payments form by clicking the checkout button.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>When items are added to the cart, a badge icon on the navbar reveals the number of upvotes in the cart. <strong>Note </strong> this is the total number of upvotes in the cart and not the number of <em>features</em>.</p>
					<h4 id = "issue_detail">Issue Detail Page</h4>
						<p>All authorised users have access to the detail view by either clicking on the contents link in the issues list or by clicking on the comment icon in the issues list. Clicking on a feature related upvote icon will also take the user to the detail view. The detail view gives the total text for content and progress, along with the category, number of votes and fees. Within this view a user can also add a comment or upvote the item providing the item is ongoing or pending. For completed items upvotes and comments are no longer required. However the detail can still be viewed by users as there may be solutions that can relate to new problems. For example a user may be experiencing a bug that was dealt with by BITS a year ago. There is a button link back to the summary tracker list. At the bottom of the panel is a list of comments on the item. The staff user also sees ok or delete icons, enabling them to either approve or delete the comment, based on the appropriateness of the comment. The comments section also shows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the total number of comments received.</li>
							<li>the original author of the item. </li>
							<li>the comment published date.</li>
							<li>the author of the comment.</li>
							<li>the content of the comment.</li>	
						</ul>
					<h4 id = "upvoting">Upvotes</h4>
						<p>All authorised users can upvote but the procedure is different depending on whether or not it is a bug or a feature.</p>
					<h5><em>Upvoting a bug</em></h5>
						<p>Bugs are fixed for free and thus upvoting is straightforward. Click on the upvote icon in the issues list and an upvote is added to the upvote field in the issues list. A message appears at the top of the table stating that the upvote has been added. Alternatively click on the upvote button in the detail view and the upvote is added to the upvote field in the issues list. A message appears at the top of the table stating that the upvote has been added.</p>
						<p><strong>Note:</strong> This version only allows one upvote per user per bug. This is to prevent users needlessly cycling through the upvote counter inflating bug upvotes. If a user has already upvoted a bug in the issues list or in the detail view a message will be returned to say "Sorry you have already voted". In summary a user can upvote as many bugs as they like but only <strong>once!</strong> </p>
					<h5><em>Upvoting a feature</em></h5>
						<p>Upvotes for a feature are linked to payments and thus are channelled through the cart and <a href = "#payments" title = "Go to the payments section">payments</a> system. When any authorised user clicks the upvote icon in the issues list they are redirected to the issues detail page where there is an upvote facility in the form of a button and input box. Cycle through the number selector to upvote or type in the desired number of upvotes. A user can have as many upvotes as they want but each upvote costs 50 euros. Once the number of votes are selected and the upvotes submitted they are entered into the <a href = "#view-cart" title = "Go to cart section">cart</a>. The cart holds the contents until the user has made payment through the checkout or logs out. A user can return to the tracker list and add upvotes to as many features as they wish all of which will be stored in the cart. Upvotes are only added to respective features when payment has been received. On successful payment, a message is returned at the top of the page stating "You have successfully paid and added upvotes to the feature" </p>
					<h4 id = "payments">Checkout</h4>
						<p>This version uses the stripe processing method of payment. Access to the payment <a href = "#payment-forms" title = "Go to payments form section">forms</a> is by clicking on the checkout button in the cart. Clicking this button presents the payments page which contains an order form showing:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>the title of the feature upvoted.</li>
							<li>the first 5 words of the content.</li>
							<li>the number of upvotes.</li>
							<li>the price per upvote.</li>
							<li>the total fees due for upvotes.</li>
							<li>the Grand total fees due for all features</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The <a href ="#payment-forms" title ="Go to payments form section"> payment form</a></a> is also contained on the payments page and requests personal details and card details.</p>
				<h3 id = "forms">Features Related Forms</h3>
					<h4 id="form-login">Login form:</h4>
						<p>To have any meaningful interaction with the application all users need to be logged in. A simple form is presented when the sign in button or navigation link is clicked.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>username field: Provide a username. This field will also accept an e-mail address instead of a username.</li>
							<li>password field: Supply a valid password.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Hit the submit button after details are submitted. </p>
						<p>While passwords can be changed by administrators through the admin panel this version does not have password reset functionality for users who have forgotten their password. This is due in the next version. </p>
					<h4 id = form-reg>Registration Form:</h4>
						<p>For brand new users a registration form needs to filled in. This form requires: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>e-mail address: Provide a valid e-mail address.</li>
							<li>username field: Provide a username.</li>
							<li>password field: Supply a valid password.</li>
							<li>password confirm field: Confirm the password.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Hit the submit button after details are submitted. </p>
					<h4 id = "add-item">Create new item form:</h4>
						<p>The link on the nav bar takes any authenticated user to the form to <a href ="#create-item" title = "Go to create a new item section">create a new item.</a> This is currently the only way to create a new item. This form requires:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>name: A title for the bug or feature.</li>
							<li>content: Provide a description of the issue to be addressed.</li>
							<li>category: Select either a bug or feature in the dropdown option.</li>
						</ul>
						<p> Click the save button to commit the item to the <a href ="#view-issues-list" title="Go to issues list section">tracker issues list.</a></p>
						<p>Within the backend the submitted date field is entered automatically. The default status field is set to pending. Other fields such as the assigned to, assigned date, status, progress and comments are manipulated by the staff user. The fees field default is set to 0.00. Values for fees and upvotes are generated through the interaction with authorised users. </p>
					<h4 id = "editing">Edit an item form:</h4>
						<p>This feature is only available to authenticated users who are authorised as staff. Clicking on the edit icon takes the staff user to the edit form. This form will return the following fields with data in them.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>name: A title for the bug or feature. This field will generally remain as is unless specifically requested by the user who submitted to change it.</li>
							<li>content: Provide a description of the issue to be addressed. As for the above field. However further content may be added to clarify the detail.</li>
							<li>category: Select either a bug or feature in the dropdown option. There should be no need to change this field unless the user who submitted the issue misunderstood the difference.</li>
							<li>status: The default for this field is pending. The staff member once assigned, changes the status. Once the amount of fees (if a feature) takes it to the top of the list or the number of upvotes (if it is a bug) takes it to the top of the list, it gets assigned a staff member and the status is changed to ongoing. When the item is completed it is obviously changed to completed.</li>
							<li>assigned to: Following the conditions outlined in status above, a staff member is assigned to the issue according to resources and expertise. The default value is Not yet. Generally the person assigned is the person who deals with the issue but again depending on resources and expertise required other staff may be more substantially involved in providing the solution with the person assigned ensuring that the issue gets closed off.</li>
							<li>assigned date: Once assigned the date is filled in (if this field is empty) or updated (if not empty). It is used in duration calculations. Helper text ensures the correct date format is supplied.</li>
							<li>completed date: This field is filled in (if empty) or updated (if not) when all work has finished on the item.</li>
							<li>progress: This is a note added periodically by the staff person assigned, to inform other users on the progress of status.</li>
						</ul>
						<p> Click the save button to commit the item to the <a href ="#view-issues-list" title="Go to issues list section">tracker issues list.</a></p></p>	
					<h4 id = "form-comment">Add Comment to an issue form</h4>
						<p>This form allows the user to comment on an issue. Clicking on the comment icon in the <a href="#view-issues-list" title = "Go to issues list section">tracker issues list</a> brings all authorised users to the <a href="#issue_detail" title ="Go to issue detail section">detail view</a> where there is a access to the comment form by clicking on the comment button. The form has a text area allowing the user to enter a comment. This field is required. Clicking the save button returns the user to the detail page where the comment can be viewed along with the published date and author. Clicking on back to tracker takes the user back to the issues list. </p>
					<h4 id = "form-blog">New blog post form</h4>
						<p>Clicking on the new blog nav-bar link allows an <a href ="#user-perm" title "Go to user permissions section"> authorised user</a> to enter details on a new blog form. The form requires:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>title: This field is required. Give the post a name.</li>
